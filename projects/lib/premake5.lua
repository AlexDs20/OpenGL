-- Our first project, the static library
project "Lib"
    -- kind is used to indicate the type of this project.
    kind "StaticLib"

    -- We specify where the source files are.
    -- It would be better to separate header files in a folder and sources
    -- in another, but for our simple project we will put everything in the same place.
    -- Note: ** means recurse in subdirectories, so it will get all the files in ExampleLib/
    files "./**"

    -- We need GLFW, so we include it (include header file)
    includedirs "../../deps/glfw/include"
